Love got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs
Still I want you, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
All I want is you, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Baby, I've been in my bag
You don't really hit me back
'Cause I feel like I'm attached
Should've never kissed you back
Ever since I fell in love
Not quite like being trapped
More like a sickness that
Keeps me addicted bad
Hard for me to let you go (let you go, let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it (hide it)
No matter what, I wouldn't fall (wouldn't fall, wouldn't fall)
Fightin' through the thunder, lightning
Forgive me, I brought it upon mysеlf
(Ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Needed a fix of you, not just a kiss from you
I needed more
Lovе got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs
Still I want you, ooh-ooh (all I want is, my baby)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (all I want is, my baby)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (all I want is, my baby)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (my baby, my baby)
All I want is you, ooh-ooh (all I want is, my baby)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (all I want is, my baby)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (all I want is, my baby)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (my baby, my baby)
Tryna stay in my lane
But you play on the safe side
But you fuckin' me up on this FaceTime
Faded, pourin' all over you
Know exactly what I wanna do
So, baby, can you eat it from the back?
Got me purrin' like I'm Doja Cat
Keep me in your bag
'Cause you wanna hear me say I'm coming back
But this time I want support, just make it last, ooh-woah, oh
It's hard for me to let you go (let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (wouldn't fold)
Ridin' through the thunder, lightning
Forgive me, I brought it upon myself
(Ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Needed a fix of you, not just some kiss from you
I needed more
Love got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up (I couldn't give up)
I just want you, but I don't do drugs
Still I want you, ooh-ooh (all I want is, my baby)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (all I want is you)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (all I want is, my baby)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (my baby, my baby)
All I want is you, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (all I really wanted)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (is you)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (yeah)
